# Advent of Code 2020

Here are the solution to (**all** of) the Exercises to the [AoC2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) Challenges. It is mostly written in Java, some in Javascript and one in Scratch

## Usage

### Days 1-3 and 7-22:

The code for these days is written in Java, so you need to first **compile**

```bash
javac -d out Start2020.java
```

and then **run** the program

```bash
java -classpath out Start2020 <Day>
```

Where <Day> indicates the day number, you want to run.

**This only works in some terminals, for example the [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N0DX20HK701)**

### Days 4 and 5

The code for these days is written in JavaScript, so you may run it with Node.js:

```bash
node Day<Number>.js
```

Where _<Number>_ is either 4 or 5

### Day 6

Day 6 is "written" in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/).
